Shot-Sensor

Arduino-based shot sensor for long-distance shooting

____________________________________________________
PURPOSE OF THIS REPO:

  When shooting at longer distances, it can be difficult to track bullet flight and spot exactly where a round hits. Several pieces of gear can help mitigate this difficulty, including shooting at steel targets, which make a distinct bell-tone when struck. 
  
  Obviously, it can be difficult to hear this tone at longer ranges, especially when there are other ambient sounds. 
  
  On 23 June 2014, Reddit user /u/Trinitrogen posted a link on /r/longrange to his Instructables writeup of making an Arduino-powered shot sensor that lights up a bigass bright LED when it detects a hit.

  The idea has appeal, but I wanted to soup up the light a little, as well as create a modular framework for it so the same microcontroller could run more than one sensor/light at a time.

Please feel free to take my work here and create your own wonderful interpetations of it.

FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY DO NOT BE A DICK. 
I make no promises or guarantees about the functionality of any of the code or schematics here.
